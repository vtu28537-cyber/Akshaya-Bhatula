What is the best way to invest in real estate with a small budget?

Chatbot Output:

As a financial expert, I recommend starting with Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
or fractional property investment platforms. They allow you to invest small amounts while 
diversifying your portfolio. Once you accumulate capital, you can explore rental properties or 
joint ventures.
